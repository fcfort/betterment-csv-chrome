Adds a download link next to each PDF statement on the Activity page with the ticket-level transaction data for easy exporting to your favorite financial software.

Betterment is a wonderful brokerage service, but doesn't provide ticker-level transaction data for easy export. But, this data is available via the PDFs on the Activity page.

This extension parses those PDFs and creates ticker-level transaction .csv download links on the Activity Page entirely in the browser using PDF.js and Web Workers.

See https://github.com/fcfort/betterment-csv-chrome for more information.
